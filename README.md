# Digital Card Decay by Filip Ilovsky

An interactive front-end animation where bank cards pass through a digital portal and deconstruct into cascading streams of code.  
The effect symbolises the **fragility of digital information**, representing the loss, corruption, and hacking of data as it dissolves into raw code.  

Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project blends creative coding with visual storytelling.


## âœ¨ Features
- Animated **portal effect** with smooth transformations  
- **Code-stream animation** triggered as cards cross the portal 
- Reversible transformation
- **Lightweight and portable** â€” runs in any modern browser
